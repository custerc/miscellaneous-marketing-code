# Misc marketing code

This will be a holder repo for various things I've written that are useful for my marketing work. I may move some of the projects from other repositories into here to clean things up a bit over time. 

## woopra-checker.py

Checks a list of terms and desired term counts (terms.csv) and a text draft and checks the text to see if each minimum has been met. To run, put all files in a directory with python, navigate to that directory in the command line, and run this command: `python woopra-checker.py terms.csv text.txt`
